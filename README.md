# pyenv-which

Simple plugin for [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) that sets up a hook on `pyenv which`, changing pyenv's command lookup strategy.

Complete copy of [this github comment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/34#issuecomment-21297171).  

Other plugins may already do this, so probably redundant.  See these:
